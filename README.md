# Brian Lockhart Portfolio

## Description
A website to showcase my personal portfolio that can evolve as I progress in my studies. 
Initial design for the website is based off of a provided mock-up example on the websites 
appearance and funcitonality.
Used flexboxes to style layout, media queries to ensure responsiveness to multiple screen 
sizes, and advanced pseudo classes to add depth to the page.

## Challenge Guidelines
### Task:
Build portfolio of work samples

### User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open
position

### Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work 
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about
them, their work, and how to contact them 
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section 
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications 
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others 
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application 
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
